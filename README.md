### ‚ö†Ô∏è Hardware requirements | Data from Ryzen 7 5700x3D | 1 player
- CPU: 0-0.1%
- Ram: ~80 MB, it all depends on the number of tracks, the load on the platforms, namely YouTube!
- Disk: ~50 MB, 200 GB is enough for caching (1.5k tracks ~1.2 GB)

---

# üéß Main features
#### üéñÔ∏è Features
- Not afraid of the event loop, even in this case the sound goes smoothly!!!
```ts
setInterval(() => {
const startBlock = performance.now();
while (performance.now() - startBlock < 100) {}
}, 200);
```
#### üîä Voice engine
- Implementation of [Voice Gateway Version 8](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/voice-connections) [`(WebSocket + UDP + SRTP + Opus + Sodium)`](src/core/voice) + [End-to-End Encryption (E2EE üîê)](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/voice-connections#endtoend-encryption-dave-protocol)
- Full implementation of **SRTP**: `aead_aes256_gcm`, `xchacha20_poly1305` (via libraries)
- Best audio player compared to **open source** solutions!
- Does not require any opus encoders/decoders, has its own opus encoder by parsing method!
- Adaptive system for sending audio packets, its own `Jitter Buffer`!
- Requires **FFmpeg**, it is responsible for audio and filters!
- Supported: Autoplay, Repeat, Shuffle, Replay and more functions
- Works even with strong **event loop lag**!
#### üéµ Audio
- It is possible to reuse audio without conversion if it is less than 8 minutes long
- Smooth **fade-in/fade-out** transition between tracks, even with **skip**, **seek** and **tp**.
- There is a system of smooth transition from one audio to another `Hot audio swap`
- 16+ filters, you can add your own without complex digging in the code [filters](src/core/player/filters.json)
- There is support for long videos, Live video is still raw.
- There is an explicit synchronization of the audio stream, without audio filters!
#### üåê Platforms
- Supported: `YouTube`, `Spotify`, `VK`, `Yandex-Music`, `SoundCloud`, `Deezer`
- Audio: `YouTube`, `VK`, `Yandex-Music` **(MP3 + Lossless)**, `SoundCloud`
- Precise search in the absence of audio, by time and names by syllables
- There is a search on other platforms in the absence of audio!
- There is support for `related`(**related tracks**), inclusion of similar tracks
- Platforms work in a separate **worker** (thread) for performance
- Everything is described in detail, there are examples and a bunch of interfaces for typing
- Easy expansion and addition of new platforms via `Dynamic Loader - Handler`
#### üåç Localization
- Available languages: `English`, `Russian` ([file with languages](src/structures/locale/languages.json))
- You can add any language supported by discord

# üî© Other functionality
#### Own system [handlers](src/handlers)
- Universal loader: [`commands`](src/handlers/commands), [`events`](src/handlers/events), [`components`](src/handlers/components), [`middlewares`](src/handlers/middlewares), [`rest`](src/handlers/rest)
- Own framework for commands, buttons, menu selectors, events
- Decorators and interfaces are used, including typing
- Support for "hot" reloading

#### üí° Adaptive loop
- It is not afraid of **event loop** and **drift**, it just takes them into account not as a problem, but as parameters!
- The loop can work ahead from 0 to 2 ms to process objects in the loop!
- Audio sending is built on it!
- Cycle accuracy `¬±0.05 ms` with `process.hrtime` + `performance.now`

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Internal tools
- [`SetArray`](src/structures/tools/SetArray.ts) - 2 in one Array and Set in one class
- [`Cycle`](src/structures/tools/Cycle.ts) - Manages the message update system and sending audio packets
- [`TypedEmitter`](src/structures/tools/TypedEmitter.ts) - typed `EventEmitterAsyncResource`
- [`SimpleWorker`](src/structures/tools/SimpleWorker.ts) - Class for working with threads

## üéõ Interface
- Interactive buttons: actions depend on the player state
- Progress bar support with time codes
- Responsive UI - does not require reusing commands
